          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>&emsp; Forrest Ratchford is a first-year student in the Multimedia Production Program focused on Graphic
            Design and Scripting for Multimedia &amp; Web. In her spare time, she is a horror movie fanatic, she loves to play
            video games, and do artistic things like drawing, tattooing, and painting. Analyzing the graphics and the detailed
            storyline of video games has given her an interest in how they are created and designed. Her Favorite animals are Great White Sharks, largely due to seeing <a
              href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/" target="_blank">  Jaws  </a>when she was little, and <a
              href="https://www.batcon.org/" target="_blank"> Bats!</a> Fruit bats being her favorite but she has a love for all sky-puppies!
            <br><br>
            &emsp; Other than loving most creative outlets, learning new mediums to play with and express herself with,
            Forrest has always wanted to travel to <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3250.html" target="_blank">
              Japan </a> since she was 9 years old. Travelling to one of the more remote areas to learn more of the culture
            and see the architecture and all the old temples. Music has always played an important part in her life,
            getting her through both good and bad. She likes most music, having quite an eclectic taste, but not
            terribly big on country. Right now, her current fixation is Chappell Roan and Marina. It is a dream of hers
            to learn how to play the piano and the violin. Music lessons were too expensive when she was a kid so it's
            something she wants to pursue now. Keeping the music close to her no matter where she goes!

          <h2>Inspired</h2>
          <p>&emsp; Forrest has always been inspired by her mother as well as her best friend Carly in more recent
            years. Her mother had her when she was young, at 18 years old but worked hard, graduating high school,
            attending college, working 3 jobs and still having time to do things like pick her up from school, spend the
            day with her, and tucking her in at night, never making her feel neglected or forgotten but very loved. She strives to be a strong, driven, and confident woman like her
            mom. Carly has only been her best friend for a few years but very quickly became an important person in her
            life. She has always encouraged Forrest to keep going, helping her gain confidence in the things she does as
            well as a renewed love for her creativity. Forrest's healing journey was greatly influenced by Carly, she
            wouldn't be where she is today without the love and support she gave and continues to give. Forrest
            continues to admire Carly, she hopes to be as confident, driven, and compassionate as her chosen family.</p>
            <h2>Sources of Pride</h2>
          <p> &emsp; Some things she is proud of is back home in Ontario, her friends and coworkers enjoyed the short stories she would create as well as some art projects for their kids, Bluey for a friend's daughter. The majority of her tattoos she has done herself, while they are not professionally done she is very proud and happy with them. Forrest has even done some tattoos for her friends and family back in Ontario! She is also very proud of her Kill Death ratio in <a
              href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/" target="_blank"> Call of Duty</a> , which is 1, it was hard to get but her average stays around 1 which makes her proud but really, she just enjoys having fun playing the game with her mom. </p>
